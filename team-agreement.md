# Team Agreement

**Team members**: Arthur Lozano Jr, Brandon Mizutani, David Waiganjo, Wenhao Piao

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.  
Describe at least:

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
  - Brandon: Frontend, CSS
  - Arthur: Back-end development
  - David : Backend , Deployment
  - Wenhao: Front-end, Back-end, troubleshooting, collaboration.
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
  - Brandon: Creating an app or webpage would be designed beautifully.
  - Arthur: I can build out the back-end
  - David : Can develop/assist with the needed requirement
  - Wenhao: Make sure everyone is on the same page
- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Arthur: I’d like to build a stronger connection with my back-end development with dbs and back-end frameworks
  - Wenhao: writing competency
  - David :Collaboration competency
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
  - Through Standups, communication via slack, and github project management.

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
Describe at least:

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - We will discuss it as a team and try to find a solution that works for a team, if that doesn' work, we will escalate it to the instructor.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  - If one person is taking over the project, during standup we will approach the situation respectfully and we will discuss how we can all contribute, and ask if that person needs assistance with anything.
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Respectfully, we will communicate during stand ups and discuss ways in which we can help each team member.
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - We will reach out to them and ask if there is anything we can do to make them more comfortable or if they would like to switch to a different aspect of the project. We will first assume they are not adequately contributing because
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - If they refuse to acknowledge the situation after multiple attempts to discuss it.

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
Describe at least:

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - Mon - Thu 6:30pm to 9:30pm, Sat 9:00am - 6:00pm and as much as needed if we all time. Mainly during class. We understand that because of our work/life schedule, hours of communication might vary.
- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Slack
- How often will you take breaks?
  - Whenever necessary
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Meet up with the group and possibly the instructor to see what we need to do to catch up
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - Via Slack
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  - Through stands up we will communicate and express how we are feeling in terms of our project.
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  - We will have morning stand-ups so that we plan our day and listen to any suggestions/concerns. We will create as safe as possible environment for everyone to feel comfortable and be themselves.

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.
Describe at least:

- How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - We will create our project workflow on Github Project, where we will identify necessary tasks, assign tasks and appropriately move them once they are assigned and completed.
- What project management tool will be used
  - Github Project

## Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the [Presentation Deck Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jmnVceamFG8mUcP_7zaE06Ai_Jpv2nw6Io5my9m9-i0/edit#slide=id.g2accd1c413_3_31). Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.

## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - FrontEnd, Backend
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  - Github organization and all team members are contributors.
- What is your Git flow?
  - After meaningful code, team members will have different branches depending on what they are working and can push up to github. Dev branch will be the main development branch until all code is finished and can be merged to main at the end of the app development.
    - Pick a task
    - developing on the local feature branch. i.e. <name_initial>-<feature_name>
    - When feature developing is done, make PR to remote feature branch
    - PR reviews
    - Merge to the dev branch
    - Once MVP is done, merge dev to main
    - Pat ourselves on the back.
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - How many people must review a PR?
    - 2 people are needed to approve a PR
  - Who merges PRs?
    - Any team member can merge
  - How often will you merge?
    - We can have a merge party during stands up, or at end of day
    - We will merge when a feature is complete after at least 2 members review the pull request that will not interfere with working code
  - How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
    - Through slack, or by communicating with our group members
